# LibAdwaita Python Example Code

These are small Python example projects to help you build LibAdwaita applications. When I started my own app, I found there were few Python-specific examples or documentation, so I decided to publish these minimal samples. I’ll add more widgets over time. The code is simple—not production quality.

## What’s Included

Currently there are 3 example files:

- `Leaflet.py` – Leaflet
- `Stack.py` – Stack
- `StyleClasses.py` – Style Classes
